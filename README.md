# Secret to Success (Practice)

1. Question- To what extent have you implemented your learnings to practical?
2. One piece of knowledge if we truly translate it into action in our lives that one gem of knowledge can completely transform our lives that is the power of knowledge when it is translated into action.
3. Practice is the ladder to mastery, to bridge the gap between knowing an doing.
4. No accomplishment comes easily to anyone. Drill and practice result in fluency so there is no reason to assume that material or spiritual growth will occur with self-guided reading alone. Two types of people are “jignyasus” (those who are intellectually curious) and “pipasus” (those who hunger for the spiritual experience). In terms of Spirituality We need to practice devotion to reach the sadhya (goal). The knowledge of God, like God, is also eternal so first seek and internalize the knowledge, then reflect on it and repeatedly practice until perfections is achieved. 

# Success According to me-
1. To Be the best person you can be,
2. To do the best you can do,
3. and as a result of that, to feel the best that you can feel

Always be good , do good and feel good. when we practice in these three aspects in our day to day life peace , happiness , success etc all are coming to our feet easily and also progress for future and a get a successful life.

# Count Your Blessings and Not What You are Missing

# Success comes to those who manage their mind, their emotions, attitude, thoughts, ideas, beliefs and values.

# The beauty of this mind- "The Mind once expanded to the dimension of new ideas, never returns to its original size."
 
# 4 Steps for a peaceful life forever
1. Ahinsa or non-violence in words, thoughts and actions.
2. Honesty -satya or commitment to the truth.
3. brahmacharya or celibacy.
4. Give to charity to purify the wealth and aparigraha or not hoarding and becoming attached to things that we do not need.

# 3 Things to Remember to Stop Wasting Time in Life.

1. Mind will make excuses. Don't listen to it.  When you are committed to something, you will do it whether you like or not. Be aware that God and Guru are with you and watching you all the time. This awareness needs dedication and no carelessness. The biggest motivating point is that this human life is a golden chance for the salvation of our soul. One moment wasted is the moment lost forever. 
2. The biggest loss is the moment not used in remembering God. We don't do it because of carelessness. When the motivation is there challenging thing becomes easy. We need to have deep hunger. 
3. There are 3 special graces. Human form, guidance of saint and hunger for God. Hunger needs to be deepened. Deeper the hunger, the harder we shall endeavor. What a motivating words from Swamiji for the ultimate goal of life. Do like, comment and share with your near and dear ones.

# 3 Ways to Overcome Laziness and Staying Motivated

1. Laziness is the biggest disease of the body and mind.  This carelessness and negligence hinders our progress on our path of sucess or devotion as well.   It is a reality of our life.  We need to learn to eradicate it. We have to make a conscious choice to commit to excellence.  Exert your physical, mental, and intellectual faculties to achieve perfection.  Inspire yourself every time the mind tells otherwise.  Build your enthusiasm by bringing the right knowledge to your intellect.  Remember the importance of the human birth and what your goal is.  Repeatedly align your thoughts and actions with such knowledge until it becomes second nature to you!  
2. Our mind is made of the material energy/Maya, and it makes us dance on its tune, it makes us more vulnerable to laziness & procrastination at work and at doing daily Sadhna. "Daily Sadhna" is the food for the soul. It is more important than eating. Hence, we need to inspire/cheer up ourselves to go beyond the turbulences of the 'mind' by governing it with the intellect, with the sublime knowledge.
3. to keep yourself motivated do Continuously reminding yourself of the Goal, Reading motivational books, watching motivational lectures.

# Reason to never to Give up in Life

Difficulties help us grow, yet we run from them.  If we can understand that real inner growth happens in the face of challenges and adversities, we will not be tormented by difficulties. God deliberately allows hardships so that we build our inner physical, mental, and spiritual resources and transcend to greater heights!  Such a beautiful way of looking at problems and facing them.  Let us all embrace such thinking and move ahead in life!

# 3 levels of Focus

3 terms explained by Maharshi Patanjali - Dhaarna, Dhyaan, Samadhi. Then he mainly discusses on 'Sanyam' (the 4th term), which means 'All Round Control,' which comes with 'Passionate Zeal.' When one is deeply passionate about something, one gets totally/deeply absorbed in it. This is called 'Sanyam'/complete control, and by cultivating this wonderful virtue within, one reaches perfection/success. 
## "जिन खोजा तिन पाइयां, गहरे पानी पैठ। मैं बौरी डूबन डरी, रही किनारे बैठ।"

# Knowledge holds the key to eradicating our ignorance.  We should harbor the attitude of learning at all times - an important tool for our growth!

# Never Suffer in life Understand it
```
B.G 2.63-
attachment and desire are the sources of all mental afflictions. When a desire is unfulfilled, it leads to anger. Anger ---> delusion ---> bewilderment of memory ---> ruin of the intellect ---> failure to discriminate ---> downfall of the soul.
